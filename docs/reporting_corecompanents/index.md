# Core Components
No matter what application is used there should be the following core components with the product itself:

## Cover Page

What is the product for?
Can this product be shared outside of NHSE?
What data sources are used?
When was the product refreshed?
Key contact information?
Version?
Link to guidance?

## Main product

Overview page/tab: to highlight key observations form the data
Focused pages/tabs

## Metric Descriptions

Each metric used in the dashboard should be documented here (or linked to)

## Data Quality/Submission Compliance

Where a product utilises a sitrep or submission data it is best practice to either display or link to a submission compliance or data quality report

## Coding

A link to the GitHub repo where the underlying code for the product can be found
